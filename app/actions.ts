export async function determineAction(text: string, emoji?: string, todos?: TodoItem[], model: string = "vif-llama") {
    console.log("Determining action...");
    console.log(text, emoji, todos);

    const prompt = `
        The user has entered the following text: ${text}
        ${emoji ? `The user has also entered the following emoji: ${emoji}` : ""}
        Determine the action or multiple actions to take based on the given context.
        Return an array of actions.

        Don't make assumptions about the user's intent, the todo list is very important to understand the user's intent.
        Go through the todo list and make sure to understand the user's intent based on the todo list.
        All the text should be in lowercase!!

${todos ? `<todo_list>
${todos?.map(todo => `- ${todo.id}: ${todo.text} (${todo.emoji} ${todo.completed ? "completed" : "incomplete"})`).join("\n")}
</todo_list>` : ""}

        The action should be one of the following: ${["add", "delete", "mark", "sort", "edit", "clear"].join(", ")}
        - If the action is "add", the text and emoji should be included.
        - If the action is "delete", the todoId should be included.
        - If the action is "mark", the todoId should be included and the status should be "complete" or "incomplete".
        - If the action is "sort", the sortBy should be included.
        - If the action is "edit", both the todoId (to identify the todo to edit) and the text (the new content) should be included.
        - If the action is "clear", the user wants to clear the list of todos with the given listToClear(all, completed, incomplete).
        
        For the add action, the text should be in the future tense. like "buy groceries", "make a post with @theo", "go for violin lesson"
        ${emoji ? `Change the emoji to a more appropriate based on the text. The current emoji is: ${emoji}` : ""}
     
        Some queries will be ambiguous stating the tense of the text, which will allow you to infer the correct action to take on the todo list. 
        The add requests will mostly likey to be in the future tense, while the complete requests will be in the past tense.
        The emojis sent by the user should be prioritized and not changed unless they don't match the todo's intent.
        The todo list is very important to understand the user's intent.
        
        IMPORTANT: You must always use the todo's ID for the actions delete, mark, and edit. Do not use the text to identify todos.
        Example: "todo id: '123abc', todo text: 'buy groceries', user request: 'bought groceries', action: 'mark', todoId: '123abc', status: 'complete'"
        Example: "todo id: '456def', todo text: 'make a post with @theo', user request: 'i made a post with @theo', action: 'mark', todoId: '456def', status: 'complete'"
        Example: "request: 'buy groceries', action: 'add', text: 'buy groceries', emoji: 'ðŸ›’'"

        The edit request will mostly be ambiguous, so make the edit as close to the original as possible to maintain the user's context with the todo to edit.
        Some word could be incomplete, like "meet" instead of "meeting", make sure to edit the todo based on the todo list since the todo already exists just needs a rewrite.

        Example edit requests:
        "todo id: '789ghi', original text: 'meeting w/ John', user request: 'i meant meet Jane', action: 'edit', todoId: '789ghi', text: 'meeting w/ Jane'"
        "todo id: '012jkl', original text: 'buy groceries', user request: 'i meant buy flowers', action: 'edit', todoId: '012jkl', text: 'buy flowers'"
        "todo id: '345mno', original text: 'go for violin lesson', user request: 'i meant go for a walk', action: 'edit', todoId: '345mno', text: 'go for a walk'"

        Example clear requests:
        "user request: 'clear all todos', action: 'clear', listToClear: 'all'"
        "user request: 'clear my completed tasks', action: 'clear', listToClear: 'completed'"
        "user request: 'remove all incomplete items', action: 'clear', listToClear: 'incomplete'"
        "user request: 'start fresh', action: 'clear', listToClear: 'all'"
        "user request: 'delete finished tasks', action: 'clear', listToClear: 'completed'"
        "user request: 'clean up my list', action: 'clear', listToClear: 'all'"
    `;
